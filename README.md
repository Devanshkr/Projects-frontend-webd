Hey, I am an intermediate front end web developer and below are the projects I have done so far.

1) I created a simple webpage using html and css - https://spotifyfrontenddev.netlify.app/
source code is available in master(default) branch.

2) I created a image carousel, sliding infinitely in a loop using vanilla javascript - https://hardcore-edison-4c7608.netlify.app/
source code present in folder - proj2 vanilla js. (Refresh the webpage once or twice if it does not work properly)
